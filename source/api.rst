Application Programming Interface (API)
-----------------------------------------

|geisa-api-hdr|

For GEISA applications to be interoperable across multiple platforms,
the GEISA specification establishes a well-defined set of APIs between the
application and the platform implementation.  
:doc:`/api/architecture` discusses the mechanics of the API.

The GEISA API offers the transactions sets for the following purposes:

- :doc:`/api/discovery`

    Provides the capabilities of platform, including the device type and 
    platform capabilities (e.g. available sensors, actuators, interfaces etc.)

- :doc:`/api/status`

    Provides the current status of the platform, including meter mode (normal, 
    test, alt), communications status, power status (powered, outage), and 
    resource availability.

- :doc:`/api/instantaneous`

    Streaming one second (or better) metrology data for applications that need 
    to continuously monitor conditions, without consuming and analyzing 
    waveform data directly.

- Billing Data

    Billing quantities generated by a meter register (e.g. kWh interval data, 
    peak demand, etc.). These are the same values that a host meter would 
    typically share over a meter-to-cash protocol like ANSI C12.18/21/22 or 
    DLMS/COSEM.

- :doc:`/api/networking`

    Allows applications to communicate off-device either via messaging or 
    direct IP sockets.

- :doc:`/api/waveform`

    Allows applications to obtain the details on the waveform data frame 
    definition and to activate or detactivate waveform data streaming.

- Other Metering Data

    Specialized metering quantities that meters may record and that applications
    may request, but that are not so widely used as to be included in the
    Instantaneous Data transaction definition.

- Actuator Status & Control

    Allows applications to query the status of actuators, such as a remote 
    disconnect switch, secondary contactor, and auxiliary relays, and if 
    permitted by the application deployment manifest, to control them.  

- :doc:`/api/sensors` 

    Exposes sensor data such as temperature, humidity, location, seismic data, 
    vibration, acceleration, and light / solar radiation.

- Event Data

- System Messaging


.. note::

  Additional transaction sets may be added in future versions of the GEISA 
  specification.
