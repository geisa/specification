Hardware Expectations
---------------------

The GEISA specification is written to align with the hardware
already in use by platform vendors serving electric utilities.
This version of the specification refers to hardware *expectations*,
rather than hardware *requirements*, because it does not require
binary compatibility. [#]_  Neverthless, it is important to define
the expected hardware deployment platform, as it informs a variety
of design decisions.

A full GEISA compliant platform, including ADM, API, and LEE or VEE interoperability
conformance, should be realizable on:

- ARMv7 CPU with NEON extensions
- 512 MB of RAM
- 1 GB of Flash
- One (or more) network interfaces
- One (or more) metrology interfaces

As this version of the specification does *not* require binary compatibility,
but is limited to source-code compatibility only, platform implementers MAY 
choose to use alternate CPUs and/or fewer resources; however, 
platform implementers should be aware that:

- It MAY NOT be possible to implement a fully conformant (ADM, API, and EE) 
  platform on a device with fewer resources
- If GEISA is extended to include binary compatibility in the future, ARM
  CPUs are expected to be the exclusive target architecture for LEE |geisa-lee-tux|.

The vision is that the GEISA EE |geisa-ee-globe| runs on 
a wide range of hardware platforms with various capabilities:

- Device types such as smart meters, load switches, EV chargers, etc.
- Single core and multi core
- Processor extensions and coprocessors such as GPUs  
- RAM sizes greater than the minimum 512MB target
- Storage sizes greater than the minimum 1 GB target
- Multiple networking interfaces such as mesh, Wi-Fi, cellular, etc.
- Metrology interfaces to provide voltage, current, etc.
- Actuators, such as relays and contactors
- Sensors, including temperature, humidity, location, and vibration
- Hardware watchdog
- Generic hardware interfaces such as GPIO, ADC, SPI, etc.

Platform providers offering a GEISA EE |geisa-ee-globe| MUST provide a toolchain which allows application
developers to compile applications written for the GEISA EE. [#]_


Metrology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GEISA specifically addresses edge computing enviroments used by electric utilities.
It is assumed there there is a source of metrological data available on GEISA devices.
The GEISA API |geisa-api-gear| provides a mechanism for GEISA applications to obtain
details regarding the metrological capabilities of the device (see :doc:`api/discovery`)

.. note::

    The GEISA API is not expected to provide metrological information
    when used on a non-metrological device; however, some platforms without a
    local metrology MAY support providing remote metrological data
    through their local GEISA API

Metrological hardware, at a minimum, should be able to provide: [#]_

- Instantaneous RMS Voltage Reading
- Instantaneous RMS Current Reading
- Frequency

When coupled with a billing register, metrological hardware may also
be able to provide derived quantities such as demand values, cummulative
values, and interval values.

Metrological hardware may also be able to provide waveform data.  
See :doc:`api/waveform` for additional details.  
When waveform data is provided, at a miminum, it SHALL provide:

- 128 samples per cycle (7.68 kHz at 60 Hz AC frequency)
- 16 bits per sample

Platforms may provide higher sampling rates (e.g. 128, 256, 512, 16,384 samples per cycle or more)
and greater sampling resolution (e.g. 32 bits per sample).

Depending on the device, waveform data may be provided for voltage, current, or both.  
Waveform data may be split-phase, phase-to-phase, or phase-to-neutral.  
The GEISA API allows applications to obtain details about the waveform data available
on the platform so that they can correctly interpret the information the platform exposes
through the API.

Sensors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A GEISA platform MAY optionally provide one or more sensors.
Sensors are exposed through the GEISA API |geisa-api-gear|.

Sensors that may be provided include:

- Temperature Sensor
- Humidity Sensor
- Switch Sensor
- GPS
- Vibration / accelerometer

Actuators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A GEISA platform MAY optionally provide one or more actuators.
Actuators are exposed through the GEISA API |geisa-api-gear|.

Actuators that may be provided include:

- Service disconnect switch
- DER disconnect switch
- Demand response relay

.. [#] Future versions of the GEISA specification may require binary compatibility, though it
   is likely this will only be done in conjunction with a GEISA community reference implementation.

.. [#] GEISA LEE specifically assumes a GNU/Linux environment (see :doc:`lee/operating-system`), such that
   it is likely that the tool chain in use is open-source.  If a vendor is using a commercial tool
   chain, there is no requirement that the platform vendor provide a license; however, they MUST
   provide information regarding where third parties can purchase the necessary tool chain and
   the version of the tool chain in use, and they must provide any supporting files required to allow
   the tool chain to be used to compile applications for their platform.

.. [#] Note: inductively powered devices, such a remote fault indicators, may lack a ground reference
   and thus may be unable to provide voltage data.  Similarly, some devices may lack a current
   sensor and may be limited to voltage only.  Electric meters are expected to be able to provide both.
