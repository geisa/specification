Firmware Management
----------------------

Firmware management is the process of updating the core operating system for an
ADM compliant GEISA platform.

The LwM2M singleton object ``/5/0 Firmware Update`` represents the firmware
update *process*, not simply the firmware image stored on the device.  Object
``/5/0`` is advertised during initial Registration, and object ``/5/0`` is not
deleted by the GEISA platform client after an upgrade; only the ``/5/0/3
State`` and ``/5/0/5 Update Result`` resources are reset after an upgrade to
reflect the new baseline.

The multi-step Firmware Update transaction typic  ally involves the EMS *Observe*
``/5/0/3 State`` so that the GEISA platform client will provide asynchronous
updates of client state changes to the EMS, after which the EMS will proceed with
subsequent steps in the transaction.  Although it is technically possible to
*Observe* resources ``/5/0/3`` and ``/5/0/5`` following initiation of the update
transaction, in order to avoid transaction dead locks or inconsistent state due
to race conditions, and to provide optional support for resource ``/5/0/14
Automatic Upgrade at Download``, a GEISA ADM conformant EMS SHALL perform the
following:

*  *Observe* ``/5/0/3 State`` when object ``/5/0`` is advertised during GEISA
   platform Registration 
*  *Read* ``/5/0/5 Update`` Result after Notification that ``/5/0/3 State = Idle``


Depending on EMS capabilities, LwM2M allows either of the following methods for
firmware image distribution to the GEISA platform:

*  PUSH (CoAP block-wise transfer) via *Write* of the opaque binary image to ``/5/0/0 Package``
*  PULL via *Write* to resource ``/5/0/1 Package URI`` for the GEISA platform to download via CoAP/HTTP as soon as practical


The following sequence diagrams provide two examples of GEISA conformant
upgrades of the platform firmware.  The first example demonstrates PUSH of the
firmware image to ``/5/0/0 Package``, as shown in :numref:`fota-push-image`
followed by the EMS performing a manual *Execute* ``/5/0/2`` to trigger the
upgrade in :numref:`fota-push-activate`.

The second example, as shown in :numref:`fota-pull-initiate`, demonstrates the
PULL of the firmware image from the URL set by the EMS into ``/5/0/1 Package
URI``.  As shown in :numref:`fota-pull-automatic`, the ADM conformant GEISA
platform automatically executes the upgrade after the download per the EMS
setting ``/5/0/14 Automatic Upgrade = True``.
